// Every property the dashboard reads off a message-bus event, checked against
// the names the services actually publish.
//
// Nothing else checks this. The message bus does not validate what a publisher
// sends against the event type it declared (`// TODO - ensure properties are
// valid` in its websocket service), and a misspelt name on this side is not an
// error anywhere: it reads as `undefined`, and the handler quietly does the
// wrong thing. That is how the update handlers read `name` and `cid` for three
// years, drawing a nameless second card and never removing the real one, and
// how a failed uninstall never reset its spinner because it looked for `id`.
//
// The list is copied from the publishers by hand -- there is no build-time
// path from their Go sources to here -- and a name added on that side is added
// here when the handler that reads it is written.
