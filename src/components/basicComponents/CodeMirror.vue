<!--
 * Replaces vue-codemirror@4, a Vue 2-only wrapper. Its successor (v6) requires
 * CodeMirror 6, a rewrite in which modes become Lezer packages and addons
 * become extensions; codemirror@5 itself is still maintained and has no
 * framework binding, so the wrapper was the only Vue 2 piece to own.
 *
 * Covers what the two call sites use and nothing more: `value` in, `input` out,
 * a `ready` event carrying the instance, and the same `.vue-codemirror` root
 * element - _filebrowser.scss sizes the file editor through that class.
 *
 * Dropped with the library: the merge view, `code` as an alias of `value`, the
 * gutter markers (`marker` / `unseenLines`), the `name` and `placeholder`
 * attributes, global options and events, the deep `options` watcher, and the 18
 * CodeMirror events it re-emitted under two spellings each. No call site used
 * one; both change their options through the instance, not through the prop.
